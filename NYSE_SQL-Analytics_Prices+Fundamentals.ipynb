{"cells":[{"source":"**Introduction**\n\nThis project uses the “New York Stock Exchange” dataset published on Kaggle (files: prices.csv, prices-split-adjusted.csv, securities.csv, fundamentals.csv). It contains daily OHLCV prices (2010–2016) for S&P 500 constituents, plus sector classifications and company fundamentals (annual financial statement metrics). It’s interesting because it lets us connect market behavior (returns, volatility, liquidity) with business fundamentals (growth, profitability, leverage) using SQL only.\n\n**How to access / download**\n- Go to the Kaggle page and download the dataset files (CSV) through this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse?resource=download.\n- Import into your SQL engine (SQLite / Postgres / MySQL). Example (SQLite): create tables then .mode csv + .import.\n\n**Note on finance definitions used below**\n- Returns are computed from split-adjusted close (from prices-split-adjusted.csv) and use first vs last trading day of 2016. This excludes dividends (so it’s not total shareholder return).\n- “Sharpe-like” uses 0% risk-free and daily mean/vol scaled to annual.","metadata":{},"id":"86ecf595-862f-487e-9553-b93afa70c917","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"**1) Liquidity: Which stocks dominated trading in 2016 (avg daily $ volume)?**\n\n_Question :_

Liquidity was concentrated in a small set of mega-caps (Tech + big banks), which matters for execution and portfolio capacity. On fundamentals, Energy had negative sector net margins in 2015, and the 2015→2016 analysis suggests a rebound effect: negative-margin firms delivered the highest average returns the next year. Leverage varies strongly by sector (Financials highest), but volatility is not purely explained by leverage (Energy is the clearest counterexample).\n\n**Limitations :**\n\n- Returns exclude dividends (not total shareholder return).\n- Fundamentals coverage is much richer for 2012–2015 than 2016 in this dataset.\n- Accounting metrics can be noisy/outlier-prone (impairments, one-offs), so interpretation benefits from winsorization or robust stats (not shown here).","metadata":{},"id":"f6a787a0-7e56-43e8-84cf-1a4ddb99b724","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (User venv)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.12.11","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
